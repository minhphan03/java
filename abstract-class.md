In the inheritance hierarchy, classes become more specific and concrete with each new subclass. If you move from a subclass back up to a superclass, the classes become more general and less specific. **Class design should ensure that a superclass contains common features of its subclasses.** Sometimes a superclass is so abstract that it cannot be used to create any specific instances. Such a class is referred to as an abstract class

Abstract classes are like regular classes, but you cannot create instances of abstract classes using the new operator. An abstract method is defined without implementation. Its implementation is provided by the subclasses. A class that contains abstract methods must be defined as abstract.

The constructor in the abstract class is defined as protected, __because it is used only by subclasses__. When you create an instance of a concrete subclass, its superclassâ€™s constructor is invoked to initialize data fields defined in the superclass.

* This is an example of an abstract class:

```java
public abstract class GeometricObject {
  private String color = "white";
  private boolean filled;
  private java.util.Date dateCreated;

  /** Construct a default geometric object */
  protected GeometricObject() {
    dateCreated = new java.util.Date();
  }

  /** Construct a geometric object with color and filled value */
  protected GeometricObject(String color, boolean filled) {
    dateCreated = new java.util.Date();
    this.color = color;
    this.filled = filled;
  }

  /** Return color */
  public String getColor() {
    return color;
  }

  /** Set a new color */
  public void setColor(String color) {
    this.color = color;
  }

  /** Return filled. Since filled is boolean,
   *  the get method is named isFilled */
  public boolean isFilled() {
    return filled;
  }

  /** Set a new filled */
  public void setFilled(boolean filled) {
    this.filled = filled;
  }

  /** Get dateCreated */
  public java.util.Date getDateCreated() {
    return dateCreated;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "created on " + dateCreated + "\ncolor: " + color +
      " and filled: " + filled;
  }

  /** Abstract method getArea */
  public abstract double getArea();

  /** Abstract method getPerimeter */
  public abstract double getPerimeter();
}
```

* the subclass must include all the abstract methods in the superclass. For example the Rectangle class:

```java
public class Circle extends GeometricObject {
  private double radius;

  public Circle() {
  }

  public Circle(double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  /** Return radius */
  public double getRadius() {
    return radius;
  }

  /** Set a new radius */
  public void setRadius(double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  @Override /** Return area */
  public double getArea() {
    return radius * radius * Math.PI;
  }

  /** Return diameter */
  public double getDiameter() {
    return 2 * radius;
  }

  @Override /** Return perimeter */
  public double getPerimeter() {
    return 2 * radius * Math.PI;
  }

  /* Print the circle info */
  public void printCircle() {
    System.out.println("The circle is created " + getDateCreated() +
      " and the radius is " + radius);
  }
}

```
